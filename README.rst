SolarWolf is an action/arcade game written entirely in Python.
It is free and open source, released under the LGPL license.

The game is originally based of one of my childhood favorites,
SolarFox on the Atari 2600.

The point of the game is to scramble through 60 levels 
collecting space boxes. Each level gets is harder than 
the previous. Obstacles like bullets, mines, and asteroids
cover your every move. Beat the Skip timer and grab the
powerups for your only chance.

Solarwolf runs on nearly every platform. Windows, Mac OSX, Linux,
BeOS, and a large variety of Unix platforms.
